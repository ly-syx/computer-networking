+ Ping results show that my local host can connect to my friend's computer and successfully exchange packets with his computer

+ The number of ping operations is the default four. All four attempts are successful without packet loss

+ The shortest time is the first time: 57ms; The longest time is the second time: 171ms; The average time of four times is 100ms

Summary:

+ The first hop was found to be the gateway of the host
+ When I accessed the server of www.baidu.com from my host, I went through these 13 hops to reach the server address I needed to access
+ The three times under a hop indicate the response time of the three TTL packets sent at one time to the hop. Usually, the three times are close
+ \* indicates that the response times out. When all three packets respond to timeout, the hop will be replaced and another route will be selected to reach the destination address
